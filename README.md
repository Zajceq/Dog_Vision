# Dog_Vision

This is one of the projects I completed in the Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp course. It's an example of using deep learning to classify the breed of a dog from a photo. Notebook in this project contains an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.
